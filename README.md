<h6>
For this project, you will create a Core Data based Diary App in Swift. 
You will be responsible for creating the data layer, all code as well as the UI. 
You are free to follow the mockups provided or design your own UI, provided the user experience is clear. Given the relatively short feature set for this app, students should give special attention to writing clean, extensible code, unit tests, error handling and selecting just the right Swift language “tools” for the job. 
If that means lots of refactoring and getting peer reviews prior to submission, we hope you take the time to do so.</h6>

####Be sure your app offers the following features, at a minimum:

- [ ] A basic master-detail view architecture 
- [ ] Ability to create text journal entries, which should display a timestamp 
- [ ] Ability to edit and/or delete an existing journal entries
- [ ] Ability to add geolocation data to an entry
- [ ] Comprehensive unit testing coverage for your code

####In order to gain a rating of exceeds expectations, please implement at least TWO of the following features: 
- [ ] Ability to add a photo, or multiple photos to an entry 
- [ ] Ability to add a voice memo or sound file to an entry 
- [ ] Ability to share an entry via email, Facebook or Twitter 
- [ ] Ability to search all entries via a search bar on the Master View

<h6>For those features listed as extra credit, you may employ third party libraries, if you find that helpful.</h6>
